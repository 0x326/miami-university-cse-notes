# CSE Notes

Some of my computer science courses require very detailed and comprehensive notes.
Since my notes have been very helpful to me, I occurred to me that someone else
might find them useful as well.

I have posted a copy of them here and released them under an open-source license.
If you find this repo useful, feel free to give it a star on GitHub.
